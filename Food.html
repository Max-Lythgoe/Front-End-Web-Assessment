		<p>Here's a picture of my neighborhood. It's got a park that we call the Red Park (although nowadays it's gone pink) in the upper right corner. And just outside of my neighborhood we've got these great fields with horses and farms just to the left along with a river and even a pond further out. It's a pretty great place to be.</p>
